You are asked to design the database for a learning management system (LMS) identical to UCT’s Vula. You are restricted to what Vula shows; do <strong><u>not</u></strong> include your own ideas for a LMS. Consider only course sites, not project sites; cover assignments, gradebook, tests/quizzes, resources and forums, but <strong><u>not</u></strong> other tools such as sessions, announcements, calendar, wiki, chat room, course evaluations, external tools like lecture videos/Automarker, etc.

<ul>

 <li>Draw an <strong>ER </strong>(entity-relationship) model of Vula, using the ER notation from lectures. If necessary, state any assumptions you have made and list any constraints that cannot be</li>

</ul>

shown on the diagram.                                                                                                            [8]

<ul>

 <li>Give the <strong>relation scheme </strong>derived from your ER model: give each relation name with the names of its attributes in brackets, underlining the attributes of the primary key.   [3]</li>

 <li>List the <strong>FDs </strong>(functional dependencies) that hold for the attributes in your ER model. NB FDs with the same left hand side can be combined e.g. replace A→B and A→C by A→BC           [3]</li>

 <li>Is your relation scheme in <strong>3<sup>rd </sup>normal form </strong>(yes/no)? If yes, state briefly why. If not, either give a 3NF relation scheme for this data, or explain why it is better not to do so.              [1]</li>

 <li>Create an <strong>application</strong> that allows users to perform some meaningful operations (of your own choice) using the database from Database Assignment 1. You may alter its relation scheme and/or data content if necessary. You may use any programming language. Note there are NO marks for the interface, as the focus of this assignment is accessing the</li>

</ul>

database.  A mark of 3 will be given for a straight forward app that works correctly.          [4]

<ul>

 <li>State the <strong>contribution</strong> of each person in the group. [1]</li>

</ul>




If you do a hand-drawn ER diagram, submit this to Computer Science Reception by the due date, <strong>keep a copy of your own as backup</strong>, and sign the ER Diagram Submission Sheet at Reception.
